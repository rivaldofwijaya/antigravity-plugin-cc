# antigravity-cli-runtime

Internal contract for the `antigravity:antigravity-pair` subagent. Not user-facing. This documents the one helper the subagent calls and the rule it follows.

## Primary helper

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/antigravity.mjs" delegate "<task>" [flags]
```

`delegate` hands the task to Google's Antigravity CLI (`agy`) non-interactively via `agy -p`. It is **write-capable by default** — Antigravity can edit files and run commands in this repo. Contain it with `--read-only`, `--sandbox`, or `--plan` when the task should not mutate the working tree, while remembering that containment is defence in depth rather than a hard write barrier.

## The one rule: thin forwarder

The subagent makes **exactly one** Bash call to `delegate` and returns its stdout **verbatim**.

- Do not inspect the repo, read files, run git, or pre-analyze before forwarding.
- Do not reword, summarize, truncate, or reformat the companion's output.
- Do not chain calls or call any other subcommand.
- Pass the user's task and any caller-supplied flags straight through.

The companion owns binary detection, sandboxing, timeouts, the conversation id, and quota handling (on `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` it surfaces the reset window recovered from the log). The subagent's job is to forward and relay.

## Flags on `delegate`

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--background` | Spawn a background job; returns a job id instead of blocking. |
| `--sandbox` | Ask `agy` to contain the run from the real tree. |
| `--read-only` | Add `--sandbox` plus an explicit no-write preamble. |
| `--plan` | Ask Antigravity for a plan via `--mode plan`, with `--sandbox`. |
| `--model <id>` | Select a model for this run. |
| `--effort low\|medium\|high` | Select reasoning effort for this run. |
| `--continue`, `-c` | Continue the most recent Antigravity conversation. |
| `--conversation <id>` | Continue a specific conversation by id. |
| `--add-dir <path>` | Grant access to an extra directory (repeatable). |
| `--print-timeout <go-dur>` | Cap the print-mode run, e.g. `10m`, `90s`. |

## Model and planning controls

Use `--model <id>` for a per-run model selection and `--effort low|medium|high` for its reasoning effort. The companion passes `--model` through unvalidated because `agy`'s own rejection enumerates every available model. With no `--model`, `agy` uses the user's default selected with `/model` inside the TUI. Use `--plan` when the requested result is a plan rather than a change; the companion forwards it as `--mode plan` plus `--sandbox`.

## Other subcommands (not for this subagent)

The companion also exposes `review`, `resume`, `status`, `result`, and `cancel`. The `antigravity:antigravity-pair` subagent **only** calls `delegate`. The others are driven by their own slash commands, not from here.
